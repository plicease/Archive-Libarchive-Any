First of all, thanks for taking the time to try and make this project 
better!  Secondly this is an optional document, if you have a small fix, 
just submit as a pull request in GitHub, or send me a patch against the 
latest released version on the GitHub issue tracker here:

 https://github.com/plicease/Archive-Libarchive-Any/issues?state=open

I will most likely be able to shoehorn it into the idiosyncrasies of 
this project.

That being said, if you want to save me time, and speed the process, 
please do use dzil to help create and test your patch.

 - I use Dist::Zilla, and to correctly run the release tests you need to 
   install Dist::Zilla, plus the plugins that I am using, which may ake 
   a while if you aren't already using it.

 - This distribution is pure-perl so you can run all of the functional 
   tests using prove -l, no Dist::Zilla required.

 - This distribution shares most of its tests and some of its 
   documentation with Archive::Libarchive::XS.

 - Some generated content is intended to be checked back into the
   repository, which is probably a confusing and bad thing long term.

I hope to refactor some of this in the future so that it is easier for 
contributors.
